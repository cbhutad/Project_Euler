### Approach

The code needs to find triangular number whose divisors count is greater than 500. This is a tough problem and after a bit surfing came across this [link](https://mathschallenge.net/library/number/number_of_divisors). This tau function provides the way to check on this fast.

In order to know upto what primes to be considered went upto just less than 100.
The code is pretty self explanotary.
