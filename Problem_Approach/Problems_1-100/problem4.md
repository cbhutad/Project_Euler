### Approach

In order to find the palindrome product approach used was brute force. First find the palindrome number which lies in range of 10^(2xn) - 1 and 10^(2xn) - 10^(2xn-1). Now check if the mentioned number is divisble by numbers which are in range 10^(n)-1 and 10^(n) - 10^(n-1). If yes we get the solution else we look for the next lower number statisfying the condition.
